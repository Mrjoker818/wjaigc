# Stage 4 Task 2 Report: Chat and Agent Runtime Integration

Date: 2026-08-17
Baseline: `7b3ca85797ee56f381cdb0ef8b120898a84d7296` (`codex/wj-stable-s4`)

Status: BLOCKED - the safe shadow integration is implemented and verified, but
Task 1 has no same-task executor adapter for `agent-v2`.

## Scope

- Added pure, credential-rejecting request builders for canvas chat, standalone
  chat, and image Agent. They preserve caller-selected provider/model IDs,
  normalize only context, require a source version for vision, and enable no
  tools for conversation mode.
- Added the shared Agent event hook and progress timeline. They are covered as
  reusable primitives, but are not mounted in a production surface until an
  `agent-v2` request can return a valid shared run ID without changing a legacy
  response or creating a second billable task.
- Added a best-effort shadow observer. It appends only `run.created` and
  `plan.updated` to an already-created task, never calls a provider, charges
  credits, or creates an asset. Failures are contained and diagnostically
  redacted.
- Shadow bridges run only after existing image-Agent or generated image/video
  tasks have been admitted. Plain streaming conversations do not invent a task
  merely to produce telemetry.

## TDD Evidence

RED, before implementation:

```powershell
pnpm exec vitest run src/__tests__/lib/agent-runtime-surface-requests.test.ts src/__tests__/api/agent-runtime-shadow.test.ts src/__tests__/components/agent-progress-timeline.test.tsx src/__tests__/components/agent-runtime-surface-wiring.test.ts
```

The command failed because `surface-requests`, `legacy-observer`, and
`AgentProgressTimeline` did not exist and the surfaces had no shared event
wiring. A second RED confirmed that the three route entries had not yet consumed
the rollout-mode resolver. The focused GREEN run passed 7 files / 25 tests.

## Verification

- `pnpm ts-check` passed after correcting the observer to consume the existing
  `ToolCallResult.taskIds[]` descriptor contract.
- `pnpm lint -- --quiet` completed with zero ESLint errors.
- `pnpm build` completed with exit code `0`.
- Required focused regression completed: 7 files / 25 tests passed.
- The required full `pnpm test` run completed as `439 passed / 13 skipped / 1
  failed` across 453 files. The sole failure was the unrelated five-second
  timeout in `src/__tests__/scripts/stage-3-source-state.test.ts`; all Task 2
  tests passed. PostgreSQL-backed integration suites skipped because
  `POSTGRES_TEST_DATABASE_URL` was not configured.
- `pnpm check:protected-baseline` passed 38/38 with zero warnings, and
  `git diff --check` passed.
- Playwright Step 8 was attempted against the local server. All five browser
  projects stopped before product interaction because
  `E2E_STAGE4_DATABASE_URL` is required for fixture isolation. Artifacts remain
  under `test-results/stage-4-baseline`; this result is UNVERIFIED, not passed.
- Protected baseline allowlist adds only this task's report, three API routes,
  and two shared UI files; controller-owned task briefs remain unmodified by
  this task.

## Limitation

Task 1's `createAgentRun` creates and bills a distinct `agent-run`, while canvas
and standalone chat stream directly without a durable legacy task. Consequently
this task does not create a duplicate run in `agent-v2`: doing so would double
charge or change legacy response bodies. `agent-v2` execution dispatch and UI
mounting remain BLOCKED until the shared service accepts an existing billable
task/executor adapter with atomic terminal settlement. The legacy fallbacks in
the existing routes also cannot be changed safely as part of this shadow-only
work; strict `MODEL_ROUTE_MISMATCH` enforcement belongs in that adapter. No
provider fallback or client credential path was introduced by this patch.
